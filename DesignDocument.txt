Description/Requirements: Creating a program that will determine the interactions of certain nodes(chemicals) based on what they are connected to. Creating edges based on user input.
			  Need to run tests to ensure that the program will properly iterate through list/dictionary.

Initialize()
1) Sets the conditions.
2) Call Get_Nodes().


Get_Nodes()
1) Sets up the nodes for the graph.
2) Returns.(Possibly)


Tables()
1) Set up the truth tables for the nodes. (Dictionary or list)
2) Returns. (Maybe)


Run_Sim()
1) Set up and run the simulation.
2) Update any changes.
3) Call necessary functions.
