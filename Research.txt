Research Data for Project:

-Thebaine(morphine precursor) produced after E coli has been modified.
-E coli and yeast process produces opiate akaloids from sugar.
	-Process takes less than a week as oposed to the method from poppy sap which takes around a year.
	-Four strains of E coli required(Genetically modified).
		-Added genes from other bacteria(Coptis japonica and Arabidopsis).
			-This allowed the production of hydrocodone.
	-Modifications to E coli will allow for cheaper and easier production of pain fighting substances.
