-Thebaine(morphine precursor) produced after E coli has been modified.
-E coli and yeast process produces opiate akaloids from sugar.
	-Process takes less than a week as oposed to the method from poppy sap which takes around a year.
	-Four strains of E coli required(Genetically modified).
		-Added genes from other bacteria(Coptis japonica and Arabidopsis).
			-This allowed the production of hydrocodone.
	-Modifications to E coli will allow for cheaper and easier production of pain fighting substances. 

-E coli in biotechnology (As a adaptive host)
	-Manipulation of the E coli bacteria to produce insulin(First useful application).
	-Manipulation of E coli to produce opioids, and precursors
	-Have been used to produce vaccines, and immobilised enzymes(Several other uses not necessarily related to biological points).

-Ethical issues with easy production from E coli(Some believe that the difficulty to work with E coli will, in a sense, scare people away from producing in wild amounts).
	-Given that a person has a certain sstrain of yeast, they can produce morphine precursors from home.
	-Relatively easy access to make Thebaine.
